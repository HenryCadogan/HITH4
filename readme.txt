Questioning and Interrogation:


To question a character, you must click on them. This will take you to a special interrogation room wherein you are presented with the option to Question, Accuse or go back. Upon choosing Question, you will be presented with three more options. Each of these is a particular style of questioning. They are detective specific so they depend on who you chose at the start. Choosing one results in a question in the chosen style being asked. The character will either rebuff you or they will give you a verbal clue based on something they knew about the victim or what they saw at the time.


The character will only give you a clue if you chose the right style of questioning. Each character has a weakness to one of the detective’s styles of questioning. The clue will be stored in the notebook.


Going back results in leaving the interrogation room and returning to the original room.


Accusations:


When you think that you have found enough evidence to accuse the murderer, you can instead choose the accuse button in the conversation menu when you are talking to the person you want to accuse. This will prompt the logbook to appear and you will have to choose three pieces of evidence that you have uncovered. If the accusation is correct, you will win the game. If it is false or you have used the wrong evidence to accuse the character you must try again.
